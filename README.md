# Description
Use Yubico's YubiKey to authentication to Roundcube webmail.

The plugin is known to be working in production with Roundcube version 0.9.1, 0.8 and 0.7.

# Requirements
- Curl PHP module with TLS support.

# Installation
1. Install the code in the plugin directory (i.e. roundcube/plugins/yubikey_authentication/).
2. Add the plugin in your config file (config/main.inc.php). In this case the plugin directory name is 'yubikey_authentication'

```php
$rcmail_config['plugins'] = array('yubikey_authentication');
```

3. Set your API keys in config.inc.php by visiting https://api.yubico.com/get-api-key/

```php
$rcmail_config['yubikey_api_id'] = 'ID HERE'; 
$rcmail_config['yubikey_api_key'] = 'KEY HERE';
```

4. Login normally and configure your yubikey in "Settings/Server Settings" menu:
  1. Ensure "Require YubiKey OTP" is checked
  2. Set your "YubiKey ID" by simply pressing on your yubikey (only the first 12 chars will be used).

5. Test your installation. You're done!

# Security
Validation of the token is done via HMAC-SHA1 authentication over HTTPS (with certificate and hostname validation).
